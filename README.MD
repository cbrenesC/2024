**"He who opens a school door, closes a prison."**
      â€• Victor Hugo

Education helps us differentiate right from wrong choices; good ones will help us become useful to our society.
Unfortunately, not everyone has access to a good education, which leads them to make bad choices and are punished by the law **but what if this term 
"prison" is not the prison we all think it is?** I believe that **ignorance** is the 'real prison'. The quote shows how important education is to human beings, 
nowadays, education has the power to make the world a better place, it guarantees a better life for us, and this is the key to get anywhere in life. 
As John Dewey said, "Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself." **The question to think about is**: 
Do you think that the importance of learning can be overestimated? 

Honestly, this is a discussion I really liked! I believe I express myself really well.
