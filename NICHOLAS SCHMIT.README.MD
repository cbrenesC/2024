- Hello Camila,

 

Your work after the extended break has become extremely diligent and thorough. The backlog you had returned to was extensive but by being consistent, 
focused and asking for help when needed, you managed to fully catch up to the workload while maintaining high grades. You have a great work routine, and
I can only hope that you stay motivated in the future, as you did so far.

I hope this helped a bit, these are all honest thoughts.

 Good luck in your ongoing academic journey, Nicholas
